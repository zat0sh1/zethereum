# Zethereum: Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts for Ethereum

**Zethereum** is a bold initiative to integrate private transactions and zero-knowledge (ZK) technologies into Ethereum, empowering users with privacy while leveraging Ethereum's extensive ecosystem. Inspired by the ideals of internet freedom, Zethereum provides a platform for privacy-preserving transactions and ZK-based smart contracts. Inspired by https://x.com/balajis/status/1862548217986269495

## What is Zethereum?

Zethereum is a set of optional smart contracts designed to:
- Enable **private transactions** between Ethereum wallets.
- Incorporate the latest **zero-knowledge innovations** for privacy and scalability.
- Empower developers and users to leverage privacy-preserving technologies without altering Ethereum's base layer.

The project is designed to be implemented anonymously by a pseudonymous developer, "Zatoshi," ensuring that privacy is embedded at every level of the stack.

## Features

### üåê Private Transactions
Zethereum provides Zcash-grade private transactions on Ethereum. Send assets securely and privately between wallets using ENS addresses.

### üîí Zero-Knowledge Stack
Integrates APIs for the latest ZK innovations, enabling advanced use cases like:
- ZK rollups for scaling.
- Anonymous voting mechanisms.
- Decentralized identity solutions.

### ‚ö° Rapid Deployment
Unlike base-layer changes, Zethereum is deployed as a set of **smart contracts**, enabling fast iteration and reduced risk.

---

## Why Zethereum?

1. **Enhanced Privacy**: Mainstreams privacy-preserving technologies.
2. **Decentralized Freedom**: Aligns with Ethereum's principles of decentralization and neutrality.
3. **Speed & Risk Mitigation**: Builds on Ethereum as a set of optional contracts, allowing flexibility and rapid prototyping.

## How to Get Started

### For Developers
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zatoshi/zethereum.git
   cd zethereum
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Deploy the smart contracts to your desired Ethereum network:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat deploy --network <network-name>
   ```

4. Interact with the contracts using the Zethereum SDK:
   ```javascript
   const { Zethereum } = require('zethereum-sdk');
   const zethereum = new Zethereum(provider, privateKey);

   // Example: Send a private transaction
   await zethereum.sendPrivateTransaction(sender, recipient, amount);
   ```

---

### For Users
1. Use any compatible Ethereum wallet with the Zethereum dApp to send private transactions.
2. Install the Zethereum extension (coming soon!) for enhanced privacy features.

## Vision

Zethereum aims to:
- Bring privacy-preserving transactions back to Ethereum in a **legal and compliant manner**.
- Promote **internet freedom** by empowering individuals with privacy tools.
- Mainstream zero-knowledge technology through Ethereum‚Äôs distribution.

---

## Acknowledgments
- Inspired by the pioneering work of **Tornado Cash**, **Zcash**, and Ethereum‚Äôs **ZK ecosystem**.
- Building on ideas from Ethereum researchers and the global open-source community.
